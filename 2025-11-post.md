## Introduction
<p style="text-align: justify;">
In my last blog, I tested AI co-folding model for novel chemical modalities including macrocyclic molecular glue and its induced protein complexes. There are some postive feedback but no much detailed investigation was performed. As a computational chemist and cheminformation, I found it would be interesting to study and analyse these models with physics in terms of sampling effiency and energy accuracy, which could guide some practical applications in drug discovery industry. Hence, in this new article I would like to focus on two questions:

1. Which are those 'good' AI models approaching physics and also with low computational cost?

2. Can physics help to identify, refine or even rescure those 'imperfect' AI models?

## Key Conclusions at the Begining

a. Some latest machine learning force fields (MMFFs) based on atomic neural network potentials (NNPs) reach quantum mechanics accurary for small molecules. They could be used as DFT surragate for energy calculation fastly, though their speed for simulation still largely inferior to those traditional force fields with classic parameterations. Also, the fundamental architecture of NNPs might further restrict its usage in coupled with enhanced sampling techniques such as Hamiliton replica exchange or metadynamics.

b. Traditional statistical mechanics could deal with most challenging chemcial systems, but there are some tricky situations (e.g., antropisomer) that require extra cautions. If such scenario was wrongly generated by AI co-folding, it would be even more hard for physical modelling to rescure.

c. Some mature machine learning models for predicting atomic properties in cheminformatics show direct benefits on computational chemistry (though in subconscious way), some of which have accelerated simulation workflow efficiently and made previously impossible stage of parameterisation to become feasible.
